        Hello,I'm Wakarima,
      </p>
      <span class="intro">
        <p>
          Welcome to my page. I hail from Nyandarua County alias<em>the land of milk and potatoes</em>. At the moment, I live in Nairobi County with my mother and sister.Currently, I am a student at<a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/"> Moringa School </a> taking a prep-course on programming. My passion for programming developed only at the begining of the year. Personaly, I love mdocumentaries, and it is in one such documentary where I saw coding at work and got intriqued. This arouse my curiousity and here I am trying learn it.

          I attained my Bsc(Environmental Education) in 2015 from Kenyatta University. I intends to pursue my Masters in the next 2 years.I find coding an interesting field. I hope to achieve more with programming. I believe that there is room for Programming in the environment field. I am yet to find the gaps to fill but am certain technology will help ys address environmental issues in future and I want to be part of this change.

        Moringa School came highly recommennded by a number of people. This is one of the reason I joined the school. If you want to learn something as complex as codding, why not one of the best schools? I enjoy learning new things. Sometimes it may take time  but practice makes perfect. Moreover, at this time in life, I want to grow as an individual. <span class="important"><strong>My take is programming would be a good place to start.<strong></span>
