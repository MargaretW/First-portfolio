    <h3> Employment and reason for coding </h3>
    <p>I have worked in different places in different positions. Below is a list of those places;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nairobi City County as an attache</li>
        <li>Henkel as a trainee. </li>
        <li>Greenview as a Manager</li>
      </ul>
</div>
  <p> Most of the places I have worked were not challenging enough. I felt incomplete as if there was something missing. As a result, I quit! This is one of the reasons why I decided to take up coding. I felt the need to challenge myself. <span class="important"><strong>Sky is the limit! Right?<strong></span></p>
