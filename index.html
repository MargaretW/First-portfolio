  <h2> About Wakarima Wangechi</h2>
<span class="intro">
  <p> Hello, I'm Wakarima</p>
  <p> Welcome to my page. I hail from Nyandarua County alias <em> the land of milk and potatoes</em>. At the moment, I live in Nairobi County with my mother and sister.Currently, I am a student at <a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/">Moringa School </a> taking a prep-course on programming. My passion for programming developed only at the begining of the year. Personaly, I love movies, and it is in one such movie where I saw coding at work and got intriqued. This arouse my curiousity and here I am trying learn it. </p>

  <p> I attained my Bsc(Environmental Education) in 2015 from Kenyatta University. Previous, I was a student in Nakuru Girls' High School where I did her O-levels.I intends to pursue my Masters in the next 2 years. Either in Kenya or abroad. Whichever comes first. I hope I can achieve more with programming. I believe that there is room for Programming in the environment field. I am yet to find the loophole but am certain technology will help ys address environmental issues in future and I want to be part of this change. </p>

    <h3> Employment and reason for coding </h3>
    <p> I have worked at different places in different positions. Below is a list of those places;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nairobi City County as an attache</li>
        <li>Henkel as a trainee. </li>
        <li>Greenview as a Manager</li>
      </ul>
</div>
  <p> Most of the places I have worked were not challenging enough. I felt incomplete as if there was something missing. As a result, I quit! This is one of the reasons why I decided to take up coding. I felt the need to challenge myself. After watching many movies on coding, I want to see how good I can be. Plus as an unemployed youth, this will be a great milestone for me and maybe open up doors. <span class="important"><strong> Sky is the limit! Right?<strong></span></p>
